== Description
A early draft of a way to determine the size of the characters using EastAsianWidth.txt, based on the very early draft of a [Ruby interface to UnicodeData.txt]{https://github.com/runpaint/unicode-data} by runpaint.

== Install
Install the gem with

  gem install unicode-display_width

== Usage
  require 'unicode/display_width'

The easy way is to use the String#display_size method:
  "âš€".display_width #=> 1

To obtain more detailed data, you can use the Codepoint struct (c is the codepoint in integer format):
  Unicode::DiplayWidth.codepoint( c ).width

== Bugs / TODO
It does not work correctly for all characters ;). For example, there is a class of unicode characters, which is not exactly defined to be narrow or full-width ("ambiguous"). This gem currently gives them a size of 1, which is not always correct.
